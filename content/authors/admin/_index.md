I'm a mathematical physicist working on artificial intelligence.  Currently a PhD candidate at Mila advised by Simon Lacoste-Julien, 
I work on foundational aspects of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on understanding their robustness and generalization performance.  

Before joining Mila, I worked as a researcher in theoretical physics at several institutions including the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario, and the Max Planck Institute in Potsdam, Germany.  My research focus ...   I received a PhD in physics from Ecole Normale Sup\'{e}rieure de Lyon, under the supervision of Laurent Freidel.
