abstract: We provide a short and non-technical summary of our current knowledge and some possible perspectives on the group field theory formalism for quantum gravity, in the form of a (partial) FAQ (with answers). Some of the questions and answers relate to aspects of the formalism that concern loop quantum gravity. This summary also aims at giving a brief, rough guide to the recent literature on group field theory (and tensor models).
