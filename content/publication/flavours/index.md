abstract: "In this article, we report our work on the Kaggle Challenge: Flavours of Physics (2016). The main goal of this challenge is to develop powerful classifiers for the detection of \"new physics\"  -- specifically,  violation the lepton flavour conservation guaranteed by the standard model -- in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  We build several models for the challenge, which include boosted decision trees and neural networks, and report our findings on their performance. We include a cautionary tale of how the use of some specific features of the data can dramatically impact  the physical relevance of the results."
