abstract: We introduce a dual formulation of group field theories, making them a type of non-commutative field theories. In this formulation, the variables of the field are Lie algebra variables with a clear interpretation in terms of simplicial geometry. For Ooguri-type models, the Feynman amplitudes are simplicial path integrals for BF theories. This formulation suggests ways to impose the simplicity constraints involved in BF formulations of 4d gravity directly at the level of the group field theory action. We illustrate this by giving a new GFT definition of the Barrett-Crane model.
